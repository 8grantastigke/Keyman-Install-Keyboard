# Keyman Install Keyboard
 
 
Keyman is a program that reconfigures your keyboard to type in another language. This download provides a simple installer for Keyman for your language. Start by typing the name of your language and clicking the Search button.
 
Keyman for Windows can be downloaded without any keyboard layouts. This is a good option if you wish to upgrade an existing installation, preserving your existing configuration and keyboard layouts, or if you wish to use Keyman for Windows for multiple languages. Keyboard layouts can be added after Keyman for Windows has been installed.

There are two ways to install a keyboard from your computer. The easiest way is simplyto find the keyboard package (.KMP file) on your computer using Finder and double-click.When prompted whether or not to install the package, click Yes. (If you don't see thedialog box, it might be hiding behind your Finder window.)
 
**Tip:** The Keyboard/Package Info window includes some helpful information aboutthe keyboard you have installed. In addition to the name and version of the keyboard,the dialog may also show:
 
**Note:** Keyman keyboards are installed for the current user only. You can findthe installed keyboards in 'Documents/Keyman-Keyboards' folder; however, you shouldnot delete or modify this folder or its contents.
 
You must have a Keyman keyboard installed to type with Keyman Desktop in your language. You can download and install a Keyman keyboard at the same time you download and install Keyman Desktop. For more information, see: How To - Download and Install Keyman Desktop.
 
If the keyboard you want doesn't have an Install Keyboard button, then the keyboard has been made available from a third-party site. You can download the keyboard by following the links provided.

There are two ways you can install a Keyman keyboard from a folder on your computer. The easiest way is to find the keyboard on your computer and double-click to install it. Keyman keyboards have a file name that ends with .KMX or .KMP.

As with all Keyman products, Keyman for Linux is completely free and open-source. The feature grid below details the technical differences in functionality between Keyman for Windows, and the current version of Keyman for Linux:
 
This brings up a configuration panel where you can "Download" Keyman keyboards from the cloud repository. You can also "Install" keyboards via local .kmp keyboard packages. In some keyboard packages, you might need to add the keyboard to IBus by adding an "Other" input source. See help.keyman.com for more details on installing a keyboard.
 
A. The short answer is a lot! With keyboards for over 2000 languages, there's a very good chance we have yours covered. You can search for a keyboard for your language here. If we don't already have a keyboard available, you can use Keyman Developer to build one!
 
You may also find that you can install the keyboard as Administrator, then you may need to make a language association for the installed keyboard for the end user. But I am just guessing without further details on the symptoms of the issue.
 
I will log onto the computer with my admin account, and successfully install the program. I can then open it up, and add the keyboard that Jonathan is wanting. When I log off, and he logs on with his user account, the keyboard is not there, and it will not install for him. I am doing the install using RDP, and logging on as an admin. I have also attempted to do a screen share with him logged on, and do a shift right click to install as a different user and use my admin account.
 
This might be a bug. I have filed an issue against the source, and you may keep track of it here: [Web] SIL IPA Keyboard deletes multiple characters on bksp (relates to mnemonic layout) Issue #2209 keymanapp/keyman GitHub.
 
An update on the 4-character-deletion with KeymanWeb in IPA. I have tracked down the cause of the issue and have hopefully enough detail there now for @joshua\_horton to tackle it when he returns from vacation.
 
I have been using Keyman on my Chromebook for some time. Most modern Chromebooks will run Android apps so I downloaded the Keyman app for Android and run that. There is an option to replace the system keyboard with the Keyman keyboard. The Chromebook is really handy for testing a new keyboard.
 
We will use Keyman as the input tool. Keyman input tool is an opensource input mechanism developed by SIL International. We are offering two **Poorna Malayalam** keyboards for use with Keyman.
 
If Keyman for windows already installed, the browser prompt to open a link with Keyman Configuration to install Poorna Malayalam keyboard package. Otherwise click on Download Keyboard Button to download Keyman for Windows and Poorna Malayalam in a single installer.
